As long as the customer has linked his bank accounts (including non-Bank of Baroda Accounts) to his Aadhaar card, it doesn’t matter which bank account he uses to pay for his purchases. Once the biometrics and Aadhaar number is verified, the funds are transferred from the customer’s account to the merchant’s account in real time.

PIN Security
About Your Security PINs:

As reported, you must use two PINs i.e., Login PIN and UPI PIN (transaction password). You will have to compulsorily set the login PIN, when you register.

While changing the password and while subsequently using it, please note that:

Login PIN and UPI PIN must be of 4 digits and 4 digits (for BOB users) respectively.
For your safety, your password will be blocked, if attempt to log in fails for 5 times. (If your password is blocked (i.e., you perfectly remember your password, but while keying in, you keyed in wrongly for 5 times and it got locked).
In case you forgot your PINs, these can be reset through Baroda UPI Mobile App itself with the following Menu options:
Generate UPI PIN
Forgot Login PIN
While changing the Login PIN subsequently, you cannot use any of your last 3 Login PINs.
If PIN is not changed in 180 days, system will force you to change the Login PIN and UPI PIN. However, we advise you to keep changing the PINs, at regular intervals.
Password Security Guidelines:
Please note that your password(s) are of utmost importance in UPI. It is the only way to identify you, by the system. Therefore, its security is very crucial, and we advise you as under:

Please do not write these PINs anywhere.
If you feel someone knows any of your PINs (i.e., it is compromised), please change the PIN immediately.
You should change the PINs at regular intervals.
If you opt to change your PINs, you should choose your new PINs carefully.
Do not share your PIN(s) to anybody, including bank staff. (Bank does not require your user id or PIN at any point of time. If you receive any communication asking for this information, please do not send your user id or PIN(s)).
Never write down, record, or save on your mobile your PIN or other security information.
Please avoid using important dates (wedding anniversary, birthdays of yourself/spouse/children etc.) as your PINs.
Phishing, also called spoofing, is the act of attempting to fraudulently acquire sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business with a real need for such information in a seemingly official electronic notification or message. The e-mail directs the user to visit a web site where they are asked to update personal information, such as passwords and credit card, social security, and bank account numbers that the legitimate organization already has.
Bank of Baroda sincerely requests you not to respond to any emails that request personal information.
Other Security Tips:
Do not leave your mobile unattended while you are accessing bob World UPI, UPI Mobile App.
As and when you have finished using bob World UPI, UPI Mobile App, do not forget to log out completely. Further close the window completely, after you log out. Avoid closing the window abruptly, on usage.
Every time you log in, you are shown the time when you logged in last. If you feel that, you did not log in at the time shown, get alerted immediately. Change your passwords, check all the transactions, and ensure that nothing untoward has taken place.
If you act fraudulently or show contributory negligence, you will be responsible for all losses on your account.
Keeping your mobile secure by using anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall software.
Taking care to ensure that no-one else hears or sees User id, Login PIN, UPI PIN or any one-time password (OTP) we send to you when you use them.
If you lose your mobile telephone, it is stolen or you suspect it is being used without your permission, you must tell us immediately via contact centre to block your access to application so that we can suspend your use of the Baroda UPI application service until the matter has been resolved.
Please read the Terms and conditions available at our websites and mobile application login page and keep a copy of them in a safe place for your future reference. We will inform if any terms and conditions are changed through websites and mobile application.

Regulation necessitates that your bank account for routing investments is on your name. To do this, we require a cancelled cheque leaf with your name pre-printed on it. If your name does not appear on the cheque leaf, then you can photograph your latest account statement from the same bank. All investments will happen through this bank account."

195,How is an SIP initiated/executed?,"You can invest in an SIP through the Baroda m-invest app by clicking ‘build wealth’ or ‘save for a goal’ or ‘save tax’. In each case, you need to only specify the monthly amount you can invest. The system recommends the funds and once you accept, takes you to a payment gateway. Your net banking opens there and you make the first payment.
Thereafter, we contact you for getting your signature on a bank mandate (called ECS mandate). This authorises your bank to transfer the same fixed amount of money every month to the fund automatically on a pre-defined day. Thereafter no intervention is required from your side."
196,Can I cancel an SIP/ECS mandate?,"Yes, you can. You just need to write a mail to ask@barodaminvest.com"

Some products have loads (i.e. small charge) on premature exit."
198,Can I transfer my investments from Baroda m-invest to another broker?,"Yes. As your investments are held in your name with the mutual fund, you can request them to transfer your investments to the code of another broker. In that case of course, you can no longer see your money on our app thereafter."
199,How do I make a withdrawal from my account? Are there any charges on funds withdrawal?,You can place a withdrawal request on the app itself. We do not charge any fee for withdrawal. So you can always make a withdrawal at any time.
200,How long does it take to get the money?,"It takes T+1 working day for liquid funds to credit & T+3 working days for Equity funds to credit.

e₹ is closest in comparison to cash. When you pay cash, the physical note/coin goes from your wallet to someone else’s. Similarly, a user transfers e₹ from their e₹ Wallet to someone else’s.
UPI vs e₹
Unlike e₹, which is a currency, UPI is only a payment system which allows transfer of money from one bank account to another through an intermediary.
Bitcoin vs e₹
A cryptocurrency is a decentralized asset where transactions between parties are settled by a pool of users. In e₹, the central bank takes responsibility for ensuring the transactions are settled.

It can be used to carry out transactions or store value digitally, similar to the manner in which currency notes can be used in physical form."
,How e₹ is different from UPI or other fund transfer mode (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS)?,"e₹ is a form of money, a digital representation of physical currency, whereas UPI or other fund transfer modes are forms of payment. Therefore, usage of e₹ is not limited to payments. e₹ also serves the purpose of ‘unit of account’ and importantly, ‘store of value’ as it represents a claim on the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet. Moreover, e₹ will have additional attributes specific to currency which will be tested in future pilots."
